# Create an EC2 instance, configure it with the packages required
# to run a databases server and make an AMI out of it.
#
# The databases server will be hosted in a private subnet with no Internet
# connectivity. We configure the databases server and load the initial
# data onto an attached EBS volume here.
# Later on, in the ``createdbsinstances``, the AMI and EBS volume will be
# used to boot the databases server into the private subnet.

# We cannot attach EBS encrypted volumes to all types of instances. As well
# we must wait until the instance is running before attaching an EBS volume.
